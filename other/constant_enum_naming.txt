Current names

This took me a while to decide on, but I think constants
and enum values should have the same casing
Regrettably, callback names have also been converted from camelCase -> UPPER_SNAKE_CASE,
but at the same time it was a bit silly to have them be
camelCase vs. lower_snake_case for other enums; at least now it's consistent

Alternatively, we could have values be lower_snake_case, but
this would require coming up with enum names for all constants
(i.e., Color.Constants.white or something; Color.white would be conflicting with method casing)

Callback.ON_DEATH
Class.ITEM
Color.WHITE
Color.Item.GREEN
Color.Text.RED
Item.LootTag.CATEGORY_DAMAGE
Item.StackKind.NORMAL
ItemLog.Group.UNCOMMON
ItemTier.COMMON
LootPool.RARE
